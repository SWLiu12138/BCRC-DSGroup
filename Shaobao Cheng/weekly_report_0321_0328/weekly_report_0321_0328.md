# CODING
1. build a camera capture system using camera ov5640 in Verilog HDL to verify my IIC Protocol. But find some bugs
2. it's hard to define what's wrong with this system, so i decided to build this system using software programming

# Debugging
spent a lot of time debugging this system, and it's still not work
