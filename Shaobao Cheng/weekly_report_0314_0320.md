in earlier days, i have finished the I2C IP writing due to my own interests, and have finished the functional simulation just. so this week i'm trying to run this IP on Zedboard. 
so what i have done is: 
1. simplify my code
2. build a camera system which is using I2C as the configuration bus to verify it(not success yet)
3. try to use the ILA of vivado to caputure some signals

# 3. To do next
