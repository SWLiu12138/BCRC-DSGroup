# Done
  - Finished building DLA system and debugged it with simple test case0(ifmap 10x10x3, ofmap: 8x8x4), and passed
  - Tried to do RTL simulation of DLA System with case1(ifmap:224x224x3, ofmap: 224x224x16), but failed due
  to some unexpected problems(maybe the vivado bug or VIP IF problem).
# To do
  - Write C program on CPU and get the result with case1
  - Write C golden model with case1 
  - Compare the two results above
