# DONE 

## 1. PAPER READING

+ "A Low-Power Convolutional Neural Network Face Recognition Processor and a CIS Integrated With Always-on Face Dector" -- ISSCC 2017

    - using Anolog-Digital Hybrid Haar-Like Face to Filter the input image, therefore it can save a lot of power.

+ "All-Digital Time-Domain CNN engine using Bi-Directional Memory Delay Lines for Energy Efficient Edge Computing"

    - Convert signal from Digital Domain to Time Domain to do accumulation. Because of the toggle rate of Digital Domain Add operation, this paper raised a method that can change the digital number into pulse which has the different pulse width according to it value.

    - Using the Delay line to do accumulation

## 2. Conception of the New DLA architecture

+ Spent some time conceiving a new DLA architecture based on my previous design, and made many optimizations but only in theory.

# To Do

+ Prepare for the School Report
+ Continue to conceive this new DLA architecture
