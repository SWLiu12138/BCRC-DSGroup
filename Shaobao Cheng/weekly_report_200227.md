# Done
- finished most parts of the dissertation, but still some to go
- finished the cmodel build using vivado HLS
- had a test case where the ifmap is 58x58x3 , kernel strid is 1, and the output is 56x56x4. And the cmodel result is just the same as RTL simulation

#To Do
- will test YOLO-Lite Layers as much as possible and verify it using my cmodel

#Problem
- Due to the FPGA is out of my control, so the SDK program writing may be delayed
