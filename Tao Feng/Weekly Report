Writing master academic dissertation,including 
  the review of open source ISA and RISC-V and the review of deep learning accelerator.
But I have no idea how I can write the paper for meeting the request of 30 thousands words.

2019/03/28
Continue writing master academic thesis,completing the main parts of it. 

2019/04/04
1.spent about two days to learn latex for writing easily.
2.spent about one day to daw some basic visio template of digital circuits。
3.spent about two days to learn axi protocol，but some topics like atomic access was not made sence by me。
4.spent about two days to desing the icb protocol to axi protocol convertor。Now I have finish the fifo using in it and drawing 
  the schematic of the convertor.
  
2019/04/11
1.spent about four days to finish the whole icb2axi protocol convertor including writing codes and drawing some schematic but without sufficient verification.
2.spent about three days to look up some paper's abstract for knowing what are others doing.

2019/04/12～2019/04/18
  2019.04.12:
    Write the directional verification plan of the icb2axi protocol convertor including simple test point decomposition.
    
2019/04/19～2019/04/25:
    1.Finish the soc side icb2axi protocol convertor verification.
    2.Finish icb2dla bus design and verification
    3.Clip dla codes. Finish the soc side. And still doing in ddr side. It's a little bit complex.
    4.Learn computer organization and design
    
    next week plan：
    1.Make the plan in detail of what I really need to do？（soc with coprocessor or soc with bus connecting IP. discuss with Haozhe Zhu).
      The plan should include the functional requirements and performance indicators of soc, the rationale and performance evaluation of 
      each ip, the design of the overall architecture, advantages, disadvantages and possible risks. Assess the feasibility of the plan 
      and whether the risks can be solved. First, do a good job of top-level design, then start the actual work.
    2.Research on collaboration with planning, performance analysis of IP.
    3.Learn computer organization and design。
    
 2019/04/26~2019/05/09:
    2019/04/26~2019/04/30
      1.Finish learning the basic knowledge of computer organization and design.
      2.Investigate and survey about the advantages and disadvantages of soc with coprocessor or soc with bus connecting IP.
        Then I make sure the solution of coprocessor is better than the solution of bus IP, and the advantages mainly include
        reduction memory access frequency therefor performance better and power consumption lower. But some challenges come 
        including cache coherence and complier with coprocessor instructions.
    2019/05/04~2019/05/09
      1.Find some materials of rocc, a coprocessor interface of RocketChip processor.
      2.Read some papers of rocc and some papers of DLA.
      3.Start learning of Chisel because rocc uses Chisel to design.
    
    Plan next week:
      1.Do sum research of rocc useage
      2.Try to assert the work load of a coprocessor
    
    2019/05/10~2019/05/17
      1.I want to design a coprocessor which can accelerate deep neural network also fit general matrix calculation. I nearly
        finish the design of the data flow of it in deep neural network(reduce mem access, utilize data reuse, etc.)(using visio). 
        And how to make it high efficiency and low power.
      2.Read papers of YOLOv1~v3
      
      Plan next week:
      1.Make the Spec of the coprocessor.
      2.Design the archietecture of the coprocessor.
      
    2019/05/18~2019/05/23
      1.Finish the draft of the archietecture of the coprocessor design.
      2.Read some matierals of yolo.
      
      plan next week:
      1.Design the circuits of each part of the coprocessor
      
      
    2019/05/24~2019/05/30
      1.Read more matierals of yolo v2.
      2.Read papers:
        Going deeper with embedded fpga platform for convolutional neural network,
        Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks,
        A Scalable Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication Kernel for Energy-Efficient Sparse-Blas on FPGAs
    
    2019/06/03～2019/06/13
      1.Prepearations for CET6
      2.A brief look at some FPGA materials to make sure the resource for me to utilize
      
    2019/06/14~2019/06/16
      Take CET6
    2019/06/17~2019/06/19
      1.Read some articles of zynq7000 series and do some experiments to make sure the largest I/O bandwidth of it.
      2.Is reading some papers of DLA using FPGAs
