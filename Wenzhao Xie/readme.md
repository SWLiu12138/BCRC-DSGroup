Weekly Report 3.29-4.4

1.Did some research about writing device driver in embedded Linux. Inserting custom IP into hardware design and running it on Linux in FPGA requires a device driver for it and it looks pretty difficult. Now I'm trying to make a simple AXI-lite device driver. I'm not sure whether I can make it.

2.Script language Perl learning, Verilog HDL learning.

------------------------------------------
Weekly Report 3.21-3.28

1.Verilog HDL learning . Now writing a Parallel_to_Serial module to practice HDL coding. Next step is to write a IIC module to continue the practice. 

2.Embedded Linux system built on FPGA documentation writing, to record the workflow, and ensure the workflow is suitable to most hardware designs.


Plan for next week:
1.Continue the HDL learning.
2.Going to learning some script language.
3.Paper reading.
