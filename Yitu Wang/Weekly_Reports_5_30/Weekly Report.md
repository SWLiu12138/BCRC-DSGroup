# DONE 

## Code Study
Leant and ran the code of pose_estimation and triangulation in slam. 

## Block-Circulant Convolution Research
Researched on paper CirCNN (17'MICRO), especially the block-circulant convolution combined with FFT.

Did experiments on Matlab to verify the algorithm.

Found a specific nn code using block-circulant and planned to learn it. 

## Course PJ
Computer Architecture Project: Wrote code for LRU algorithm for cache replacement


# TO DO
Prepare for the final exams.
