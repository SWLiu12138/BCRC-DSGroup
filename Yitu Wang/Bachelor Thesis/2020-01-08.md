#### Preparation for Bachelor Thesis
##### Draft thoughts
+ **Main idea:** Utilizing a Processing-in-Memory (PIM) module, which can get inverse matrix whose size are between 2 $$\times$$ 2 to 8 $$\times$$ 8, to slove Gauss Newton equation in Bundle Adjustment of vSLAM. ( Gauss Newton equation: $$H\Delta x=g$$ )
+ **Parallelism:** Through the sparsity and marginalization of matrix $$H$$, exploring the possibility of parallelism of solving the equation by decomposing $$H$$ into 6 $$\times$$ 6 matrixs.
+ **Resolution:** Due to the resolution limit in PIM (usually 8 bit), exploring the possibility of reducing the resolution of operands in matrix $$H$$ (eg., from 32-bit float point to 8 fixed point) .

##### Things to do to verify the thoughts
+ **Before Spring Festival**: Review theory and mathematics of vSLAM.
+ **After Spring Festival**: Read relative relative open-source code -- ORB_SLAM2.
