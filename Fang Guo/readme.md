This week I plan to learn the code about PU of tanji-3. When I firstly read the code, I find I can't understand the syntax of SystemVerilog, let alone the function achieved by the code. So I continue to go to http://www.doulos.com and http://accellera.org to find some materials about sv. After that, I learn the data type of sv. At the same time, I contrast it with the data type of C++. For example, when enumerated type in sv is declared, the data type of enumerated name can be integer, logic or bit and so on. In C++ï¼Œso far I only know it can be int by default. There are still much content. But I still can't understand the function achieved by the code. So I think I need to continue this work.
